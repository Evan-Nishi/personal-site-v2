# Welcome to my redesigned site!
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/da1a1437-aeca-4c65-ae03-70a1b879550f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/condescending-ride-075fd1/deploys)

This time I put effort into making my website to look decent.  I hope you enjoy!
I used typescript + nextjs + google calendar API(eventually).

## Warning, sloppy code!
While the site looks decent, the code behind it is sloppy and hacky at best.  Defintely not my most refined code.

To run the site on a local development server, clone this repo.  Then run ````npm install````, after that finishes run ````npm run dev````.  The site will be deployed on localhost at port 3000.  If you want to deploy this site, or a site with the same build commands to netlify, set the build command to ````next build && next export````, and the publish directory to out.
